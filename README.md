# NODE.JS - Real-Time Chat Room w/Socket.io & Express

### About

Real-time chat application built with Socket.io, Node/Express, Vanilla JS (and a few other smaller dependencies), complete with unique chat rooms and individual users. When a user enters and exits a chat room, a message is broadcast to the users in that specific room of their action. The sidebar on the left displays, in real time, what room the user is in, and all of the users within that room, and updates as people come and go.

1.  Who is more prone to violence between Muslims and Christians today? Let's look at apostasy. Who is more prone to kill for Apostasy? If you are saying they both have verses to support death, sure. I agree. But the statistics on the view among Muslims tells you the attitude among Muslims. You will encounter more Muslims who are afraid they will be killed because they gave up their religion among Muslims than Christians. it is a common complaint among ex-Muslims.

2.  I am not confusing Islam as religion with its politics. The Qur'an specifically says it is guide for all aspect of Muslims life including politics, personal life and so on. This is exactly what the Muslims and Islamic scholars say.

Do you think Medieval Christian nations were only political and Christianity had nothing to do with it?

So let's compare how many Christian terrorists committed acts of murder vs how many Muslim terrorists in last 10 years. That is exactly my point. Where is the religion in time.

Can you tell me which Islamic scholar supports the separation of Church and State based on that Qur'an 9:60? I have yet to see a single Islamic scholar who would support it from the Qur'an. I am curious where you got it.

I said "how to criticize religion while maintaining Intellectual Honesty." If I do not want to offend, I simply do not speak. They will be offended no matter how "nicely" you put it.

Talking to "angels" and "Gods" is not evidence enough of mental illness? Seriously?
